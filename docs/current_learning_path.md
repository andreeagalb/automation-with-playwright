Your Current Learning Path

To keep you on track without distractions, here is what I suggest we do next:

    Write a "Linear" Test: Create one file that does everything (Open browser -> Search -> Check Result).

    Learn Locators: Understand how to "talk" to a website (ID, CSS, Xpath).

    Refactor: Once the linear test works, we move the setup code into @BeforeAll to make it professional.
